Whatever the outfit (or season, for that matter!), jewellery presents an accessible way to make your existing wares feel more current, and new for spring is a piece that will make your basic tops and shirts feel significantly fresher. Long, drop-like earrings that reached the shoulder were easily the most prevalent jewellery trend out there and came in various guises.

For his spring collection, he sent out pieces down the runway which featured, yes, his signature bouclé tweeds but also pieces adorned with gold braided shoulder straps and gold piping. (Several other labels, from Pucci to Bevza, also embraced the same vibe.) The effect is one that feels Grecian but with a modern twist.

What I’ve realized, however, is while I appreciate a lovely blouse or statement shirt, I am really a button-up shirt or plain T-shirt devotee. The transformed iterations of these classics and fresh ways to style simple shirting found in abundance in spring 2023 collections are all to my benefit. Luckily for me, I have Peter Do, Stella McCartney, and Bottega Veneta to look to for styling inspiration on how to reincorporate dress shirts with a sense of relevance for the spring season. And Tory Burch, Dries Van Noten, and Miu Miu have me wanting and wearing delicate layers of subdued color via long-sleeve or turtleneck tops with my trousers and jeans for the rest of winter. —Madeline Fass, market editorhttps://www.vogue.com/article/spring-2023-trends-editors-picks is a character in a</td>\n",

Late last year, I suddenly decided that my wardrobe was absolutely lacking a pair of red shoes, and I’ve been on the lookout ever since. Some great pieces have started to trickle in in the new year, but now I can’t decide what vibe to go for. Do I want something classic (Manolo Blahnik’s Carolyn kitten-heel slingback), something comfortable yet unhinged (Khaite’s Marcy shearling flat), or something less comfortable but absolutely, devastatingly glamorous (Alaïa’s Coeur mule)? The jury’s still out, but for sure, 2023 will be my year of the red shoe. —Laia Garcia-Furtado, senior fashion news editorhttps://www.vogue.com/article/spring-2023-trends-editors-picks is a character in a</td>\n",

Elevated basics is one such trend. Last season, there was a clear '90s directive when it came to minimalism, with logo vests, low-slung trousers and tube dresses being hero items. Now, things have been pared back even further; sure, Y2K maxi skirts and oversized suiting are very much a thing, as witnessed on the runways of Peter Do and Roksanda respectively, but the silhouettes are cleaner and the colour palette looks more expensive; think shades of teal, camel and navy.https://www.whowhatwear.com/spring-summer-2023-fashion-trends/ is a character in a</td>\n",

I spend a lot of my days on social media (for work, naturally), and the jeans styles that I'm seeing across TikTok, Instagram and Pinterest are so relaxed they might as well be joggers. As the world's number one fan of wide-leg trousers, I'm so happy that the grip skinny jeans had on us is finally over. Now, for the real stuff—this denim style can feel quite daunting if you're new to it. Me? I'll be taking styling cues from the master of jeans himself, Asake. IYKYK. And if you don't, you're in for a treat when you Google 'Asake jeans',\" says Joy Ejaria, social media editor at Who What Wear UK. https://www.whowhatwear.com/spring-summer-2023-fashion-trends/ is a character in a</td>\n",

For the past few seasons, we've seen the latter proportion dominate—Fendi created a microscopic version of its iconic Baguette, while Jacquemus's infamous Le Chiquito has handles bigger than its main compartment. No doubt about it, these bags are fun, but if you're more practically wired (I know I am), then you too will laud the return of the jumbo tote, as seen at Loewe, Bottega Veneta, Chloé and a slew of other designer heavyweights known for their arm candy. https://www.whowhatwear.com/spring-summer-2023-fashion-trends/ is a character in a</td>\n",

Whatever the outfit (or season, for that matter!), jewellery presents an accessible way to make your existing wares feel more current, and new for spring is a piece that will make your basic tops and shirts feel significantly fresher. Long, drop-like earrings that reached the shoulder were easily the most prevalent jewellery trend out there and came in various guises.

Yes, you read that right. Formerly reserved for brides or the red carpet, trains are big news for spring/summer thanks to designers like Bally and Victoria Beckham, who showcased everything from minis to maxis with cascading details. Choose an ice-cream shade (I was particularly taken with the pistachio at ACNE and soft orange sorbet at Giambattista Valli) and a slinky material for maximum impact before adding polished accessories. I can't wait to dip my toe into this trend ahead of wedding season and will be choosing a style with an interesting neckline to keep things on the contemporary side,\" says Poppy Nash, managing editor at Who What Wear UK.https://www.whowhatwear.com/spring-summer-2023-fashion-trends/ is a character in a</td>\n",

Utilitarian wear is in for 2023, which sets the stage for the return of the cargo pant. But these aren't the shapeless, low-rise pants of the Y2K era. For spring, this trend is translated into tailored silhouettes, interesting pocket placements, elevated fabrics like silk and organza, and colors that go beyond khaki and olive.https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-trends-2023 is a character in a    \n",

In 2023,  naked dressing makes its way from the red carpet – where celebrities like Cher and Rihanna have been sporting the trend forever – to street style. From a cellophane-like dress, worn over a boldly hued maxi skirt at Tory Burch's spring 2023 show, to a frothy frock revealing undergarments at Victoria Beckham, the previously risqué trend is coming not only for your weekend wardrobe but even workwear.https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/fashion-trends-2023 is a character in a    \n",

From double-waisted jeans to carpenter jeans, it's been a while since we were this excited about denim trends.

But we’ve got great news: Brands supersized their purses this spring, showing styles that have plenty of room for groceries, laptops, hardcover books, and pretty much anything else you could want on your person. If you’re on the hunt for a new work bag, this is your sign that bigger is officially better.https://www.glamour.com/story/spring-fashion-trends is a character in a    \n",

Whatever the outfit (or season, for that matter!), jewellery presents an accessible way to make your existing wares feel more current, and new for spring is a piece that will make your basic tops and shirts feel significantly fresher. Long, drop-like earrings that reached the shoulder were easily the most prevalent jewellery trend out there and came in various guises.

I can't wait to dip my toe into this trend ahead of wedding season and will be choosing a style with an interesting neckline to keep things on the contemporary side,\" says Poppy Nash, managing editor at Who What Wear UK.https://www.whowhatwear.com/spring-summer-2023-fashion-trends/ is a character in a    \n",

Striking red ensembles, where shades of saffron were styled top to toe, were present in the form of tights and tuxedos at Ferragamo, sharp tailoring at Alexander McQueen, impressive fringing at Bottega Veneta and tube dresses and leggings at Alaïa.https://www.whowhatwear.com/spring-summer-2023-fashion-trends/ is a character in a    \n",

Think again! The spring/summer runways bear a striking resemblance to all of my favourite coming-of-age movies from the '80s—Sixteen Candles, Pretty in Pink… basically anything starring Molly Ringwald. Between frothy fabrications, high-shine lamé, lashings of leopard print, and the glorious return of the puffball hemline, this season invites you to play dress-up and not take yourself too seriously in the process.https://www.whowhatwear.com/spring-summer-2023-fashion-trends/ is a character in a    \n",

Nighttime Glam: For a more dressed up look, opt for a liquid silver or sparkling metallic dress to make a statement at a special occasion. This trend can also be incorporated through statement accessories like a pair of shiny heels or a clutch bag.\\n\\n3. Sheer Layers: As seen in the review, the trend of transparent layering is on the rise. Add a touch of shine to this trend by choosing sheer fabrics with a metallic finish, like a sheer shimmery top over a camisole or a sheer organza skirt over a metallic slip dress.\\n\\n4. Mix and Match: Don\\'t be afraid to mix and match shiny fabrics with other textures and patterns for a unique and eye-catching look. For example, a metallic sequin top can be paired with a denim skirt or a floral printed skirt for a fun and unexpected combination.\\n\\n5. Metallic Accessories: If you\\'re not ready to fully embrace the shiny trend, start small by incorporating metallic accessories into your outfit. A pair of metallic shoes or a shimmery bag can add a touch of glamour to any look.\\n\\n6. Layering with Knits: As the review mentioned, designers are also incorporating shiny fabrics into knitted pieces. This trend can be styled by layering a metallic knit cardigan or sweater over a basic outfit to add a pop of shine without being too over-the-top.'"
